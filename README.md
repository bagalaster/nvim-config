# nvim-config

## Getting started

This is my neovim config.

To get started with this config on a new machine:

1. Make sure you have neovim installed. I use brew on macOS, so I would do this:
```bash
brew install neovim
```

2. Make sure you have ripgrep installed. This is required for `telescope` grep usage.
```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

3. Clone the folder into your config folder.
```bash
git clone -- https://github.com/bagalaster/nvim-config.git ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config/nvim}
```

4. Launch neovim
```bash
nvim .
```

5. Profit
